## PPK analysis with L1-DGNSS and RTKLIB

### Analysis Flowchart

**Analysis (Indoor Work)**
1. download the UBX file from the Base/Rover receiver
    - When using uBlox receivers
2. convert UBX to RINEX file with RTKCONV
    - RINEX ver. 3.02 is used to match the Control Station.
3. find the coordinates of Rover by RTKPOST
    - Static mode is used as the positioning mode when measuring a fixed position.
    - If the coordinates of Base are unknown: Rover's coordinates are relative
    - If the coordinates of Base are known: Rover's coordinates are absolute values
4. obtain the coordinates of Rover
    - See the text file of the analysis results (.pos)
    - In the case of a Fix solution: Coordinates of the last row with Ratio = 999.9
    - For a Float solution: the coordinates of the row with the highest Ratio

## Preparation

### Download RTKLIB
The latest source code  
[https://github.com/tomojitakasu](https:// github.com/tomojitakasu)
  - Reading the source code makes sense of features that aren't in the manual (sometimes).
  - Currently, the latest version is being developed and released on github

The latest binaries (non-developers, click here)
[https://github.com/tomojitakasu/RTKLIB_bin ](https://github.com/tomojitakasu/RTKLIB_ bin)
  - Use binaries (exe files) if you want to use it with Windows GUI
  - Download the entire bin folder

## Checking the operation of RTKLIB
**If RTKLIB doesn't work**.  
A common phenomenon in workshops and other events.

- Clicking Execute can't process it or causes an error  
→ "Run as administrator"

- Processing is started, but no file is produced.  
→ Change the version to download.

- I just can't process it (it doesn't work properly).  
-> Get a copy of the binary file of someone which is working properly.

## Download GSIGEO2011
- [Latest version of "Japanese Geoid 2011" (Version 2)] (http://www.gsi. go.jp/buturisokuchi/geoid_model.html
)    
  RTKLIB 2.4.2 does not support the latest geoid models (in some areas it does not work properly) 

- [GSI, "Geoid Height Calculatior"](https://vldb.gsi.go.jp/) sokuchi/surveycalc/geoid/calcgh/calcframe. html)  
RTKLIB can be calculated with ellipsoidal height while the geoid height can be found on this website

- GSI [“Japanese Fundamental Geospatial Data Download Service"](https://fgd.gsi. go.jp/download/menu.php
)  
  - File used: gsigeo2011_ver2.asc
  - RTKLIB 2.4.2 does not support the latest geoid models (in some areas it does not work properly)

## Download observation data

### Downloading Data from Base/Rover Receivers
**Download the UBX file**.
- Examples of EMLID Reach RS / Reach RTK
- Connect the receiver via Wi-Fi and download the data

![img](./pic/3.png)

## RINEX conversion

### Converting UBX to RINEX files with RTKCONV
- RINEX ver. 3.02 is used to match the GNSS-based Control Station.
- RTKLIB uses data in RINEX format  
- Native files (.ubx) are stored in Reach RS / Reach RTK by u-blox 
- RTKCONV is a tool for converting native files from various companies to RINEX
  - Some manufacturers' observational data cannot be converted (file specifications are not available).
- By using the asterisk "*" in the source file name, you can convert multiple contiguous but segmented files into a single RINEX file.
If you specify the start and end date and time, you can also output a RINEX file for the period of time (to make the operation lighter).

**RTKCONV（RTKLIB/bin/rtkconv.exe）**

## PPK Analysis - The basic procedure of analysis is shown with an example of not using absolute coordinates of Base

### Find the coordinates of Rover with RTKPOST
**RTKPOST (RTKLIB/bin/rtkpost.exe)**
- rtkpost.exe: This is the most commonly used one
- rtkpost_mkl.exe: if the Intel® Mass Kernel Library is available

! [img](. /pic/7.png)

- Only when you use RTKPOST for the first time, do the following first
1. change the "Positioning Mode" on the Options screen to "Static".
  - Static: To observe a fixed location
  - Kinematic: The case of observing a moving object
2. Click "OK" to close the Options screen.

![img](./pic/8.png)

- Set up Base/Rover observation data (RINEX file)
- Note the fields for setting each file in Base/Rover
- If you don't set "Static" on the Options screen, you can't set the Base file.

- All defaults
- Make sure that what should be left blank is left blank.

![img](./pic/14.png)

1. Have you set up Base/Rover observation data (RINEX file)?
2. Have you checked that all tabs in the Options are set up properly?
- Options remembers previous settings, so you need to check them **every time you analyze them**.

**[Reference 1] Output Rover's "Elevation": set GSIGEO2011 to RTKPOST**.

1. open "Options"
2. "gsigeo2011_ver2" in "Geoid Data File" in the "Files" tab. Specify .asc (left figure)
3. specify "Geodetic" in the "Output" tab, "Datum / Height" (right figure)
4. in the same tab, select "GSI2000 (1x1.5")" in "Geoid Model" (right figure).
- RTKLIB 2.4.2 does not support the latest geoid models (in some areas it does not work properly)

**[Reference 2] Using GNSS-based Control Station Data: Setting Coordinates and PCV Correction File in RTKPOST**.

1. open "Options" 
2. The "Receiver Antenna PCV File" in the "Files" tab has been set to GSI_PCV.pcv (or .TXT) (shown left)
  - The receiver's antenna file is specified in the second line. The first line is a column for specifying the satellite antenna file
3. the coordinates of the Control Station + the height above ellipsoid in "Base Station" of "Positions" tab. (right)
4. select "*" (auto-selected) for "Antenna Type" in Base Station on the same tab. (right figure)

**[Reference 3] Using absolute coordinates of Base: Setting Base coordinates for RTKPOST**

1. open "Options"
2. enter absolute coordinates of Base + height above ellipsoid in "Base Station" in "Positions" tab. 
  - When typing in dms, separate the number of degrees, minutes and seconds with a space.
3. uncheck "Antenna Type" in Base Station on the same tab.
  - In the PPK analysis, the baseline vector from the Base antenna phase center position to Rover is used. The antenna height of Base is not necessary to be input. When entered, it means the height of the "ground on which the antenna was placed". Not there.

## Know-how.
**[Commentary 1] RTKPLOT**
- Software to visualize GNSS observation data (.obs) and analysis results (.pos)
- Visualizing observation data: assessment of the number and quality (altitude, SNR, multipath) of receiving satellites
- Graphical representation of analysis results: evaluation of solution quality (Grd Trk, Position, AR)

![img](./pic/20.png)

**Visualizing GNSS Observation Data (.obs): evaluating both Base and Rover data**

- Assessment of the number and quality (altitude, SNR, multipath) of receiving satellites
- The example on the left has an overall low SNR (less than 35dbHz) and may not yield a fix solution
- The example on the right has a good reception, but the SNR of G20 and J01 is low and may need to be excluded from the analysis

![img](./pic/21.png)

**Visualizing the analysis results (.pos)**

- Evaluation of the quality of the solution (Grd Trk, Position, AR)
- The figure below is a graphical representation of the same analysis. Fix solutions are obtained in all epochs of the observation period
- Left: Position diagram showing the variation of the E-W, N-S, and U-D (XYZ) axis positions. All of them are within ±5 mm, which is good
- Middle is a Grd Trk diagram. The squares are 1 mm in scale; the gray circles are error circles, which have decreased in size over time. All solutions fit within the range of 8 mm north-south and 5 mm east-west
- The figure on the right is the diagram of Ratio Factor for AR Validation. Ratio Factor has a maximum value of 1,000, with most epochs during the analysis period showing 1,000 with little fluctuation. We're getting a stable positional solution.

![img](./pic/22.png)

- Evaluation of the quality of the solution (Grd Trk, Position, AR)
- The figure below is a graphical representation of the same analysis. The first half of the observation period was a Float and the second half was a Fix solution.
- The left is the Position diagram of the Float solution (orange), which has a horizontal direction of 1 m and a vertical direction of 4 m Fluctuations are seen.
- Middle is a Grd Trk diagram. The size of the grid is 20 cm, the error circle decreases with time, and the Float solution is 1.6 m in north-south and 1 m in east-west; the Fix solution converges to a single point in the lower left of the central area
- The figure on the right is the Ratio Factor for AR Validation diagram. Ratio Factor rises slowly, but stabilizes after reaching a maximum value of 1,000

**[Commentary 2] Key Points of L1-DGNSS Surveying and Analysis**

- **Planning**
  - The ability to continue to receive five or more satellites in the same positioning satellite system with good SNR.
  - Place the Base in a place where the reception environment is most favorable and stable. The roof of the building is best. It can be done on the roof of a car.
  - The area around the Base is off-limits. Degradation of accuracy due to cycle slip and vibration
  - Smaller baseline length (Base is placed in the center of the observation area)
  - If the atmospheric conditions above Base and Rover are different, such as rainy weather and dense fog, the error increases (The error factor cannot be offset by double difference). The same is true for large differences in the z-direction of the baseline length. In long-term observations, such effects should be taken into account, and tropospheric delay correction using meteorological data should be performed (Nakajima et al., 2018)
- **Surveying**
  - Antenna height shall be at least 2 m (to reduce radio wave shielding by humans and vegetation)
  - Rover is staffed by people who can work carefully in the harshest of natural environments.
 - Maximize the accuracy of the installation (NG: misalignment of stone pits, pole tilt, shaking during measurement)
  - No shaking (the earth rotates, orbits, and satellites orbit the earth. Even the slightest tremor during measurement can have a negative effect.)
  - Measure as far away from high objects as possible (radio shielding reduction)
Do not measure the antenna directly on the ground (the source of radio interference)
- **Analysis**
  - If the SNR is high even at low altitudes, use it for analysis.
  - Vegetative foliage allows radio waves to pass through, but reduces the SNR
  - Exclude satellites with low SNR, unstable with low SNR, and cycle slips.
  - Sometimes it's better to exclude satellites that appear in the middle of the observation period (the AR is reset).
  - Don't tweak parameters to force a fix (analyze all Rovers under the same conditions except for the exclusion of satellites)
